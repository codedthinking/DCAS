title: Launching DCAS
---
The data editors of the [journals](/journals/) of the American Economic Association, the Econometrics Journal, the Economic Journal, the Review of Economic Studies, and the Canadian Journal of Economics come together to proudly launch DCAS, the [Data and Code Availability Standard](/). This set of rules regarding what constitutes an appropriate data and code replication package will help authors comply with the journalsâ€™ data and code availability policies. DCAS provides a standard, meant to make compliance easier by setting common requirements across journals, and to help journals craft their own data and code availability policy.
